# Coffee_management app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started With firebase

This project is a starting point while we are working on email authentiation as well as making model and passing that data to firebase and can perform CRUD operation on the data and also we can come to know about how to validate form and then update data.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
